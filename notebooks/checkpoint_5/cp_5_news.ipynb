    "# Нелинейные ML-модели\n",

    "#### Обновлённый подход к извлечению признаков\n",
    "\n",
    "После предзащиты было принято решение изменить стратегию формирования признаков для задач классификации направления движения цен. Обновлённый подход учитывает как специфику финансовых текстов, так и необходимость более рационального использования вычислительных ресурсов.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Отказ от суммаризации текста.**\n",
    "В предыдущих экспериментах применялась генерация кратких аннотаций с помощью трансформеров. Однако для задачи бинарной классификации ценового движения это оказалось нецелесообразным: суммаризация может терять важные локальные сигналы, а её вычислительная стоимость высока. В новой версии анализ проводится на полном (или усечённом) оригинальном тексте без дополнительного обобщения.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Векторизация текста без трансформеров**\n",
    "Теперь вместо BERT-подобных моделей используются TF-IDF + SVD - это ускоряет обработку в десятки раз при сохранении ключевых признаков. Метод особенно эффективен для обучения CatBoost/LightGBM на новостных текстах, хотя немного уступает трансформерам в анализе сложных контекстов.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Сентимент-анализ через VADER.**\n",
    "Для оценки тональности текстов применяется инструмент VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) - это модель, специально настроенная на анализ настроений в социальных медиа. Несмотря на то, что VADER не предназначен специально для финансовых новостей, его простота, эффективность и открытость делают его подходящим выбором для предварительного сентимент-анализа в рамках данного исследования.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Увеличение объёма выборки.**\n",
    "Для обучения моделей мы используем выборку из 20 тысяч строк. При этом целевая переменная - направление изменения цены за 24 часа - была сбалансирована: из исходного набора отдельно отобраны равные по размеру подвыборки с положительным и отрицательным изменением цены (по 10 тысяч примеров каждого класса). Это важно для предотвращения смещения моделей в сторону более часто встречающегося класса и повышения качества классификации.\n"

Используется пространство параметров, включающее число листьев, скорость обучения, глубину деревьев и другие важные настройки. В качестве метрики оптимизации применяется F1 score. Подбор происходит с трёхкратной кросс-валидацией и 30 случайными итерациями. После поиска лучших параметров обучается финальная модель на тренировочных данных и оценивается на тестовой выборке с помощью метрик Accuracy, F1 Score, а также строится матрица ошибок для анализа качества классификации."

    "В рамках задачи бинарной классификации направления изменения цены на основе финансовых новостей были протестированы как линейные, так и нелинейные модели машинного обучения.  \n",

    "- **LinearSVC**: Accuracy 0.50, F1 Score 0.58  \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**: Accuracy 0.52, F1 Score 0.54  \n",

    "2. Сентимент-анализ (FinBERT)\n",
    "3. Получение эмбеддингов (FinBERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Несмотря на применение мощных трансформеров, результаты оказались слабыми - вероятно, из-за потери важных деталей при суммаризации и высокой обобщённости признаков.\n",

    "**Особенности подготовки признаков:**\n",
    "- **Суммаризация была исключена**, чтобы не терять значимые сигналы в тексте.\n",
    "- **Векторы признаков** строились с помощью TF-IDF и SVD для простоты и эффективности.\n",
    "- **Сентименты** получались с помощью лёгкой и быстрой модели **VADER**.\n",
    "- **Балансировка классов** позволила избежать перекоса в сторону одного класса и улучшить устойчивость моделей.\n",
    "\n",
    "Во всех случаях модели получились довольно низкого качества. Основная причина - **высокий уровень шума и слабая выраженность сигнала** в данных: тексты новостей редко содержат прямые указания на будущую динамику цены, особенно на коротком горизонте. Кроме того, **тематическая неоднородность** публикаций и общий характер новостей (например, обзорные или аналитические материалы без чёткой оценки) затрудняют обучение моделей.\n",

    "#### Переход к глубинному обучению\n",
    "\n",
    "Учитывая ограниченность традиционных подходов, следующим шагом будт использование **глубинных нейронных сетей**, которые позволяют работать напрямую с полными текстами и способны извлекать более сложные паттерны."
